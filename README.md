# gif-search

Tenor gif search web application built using flask.

## To get up and running:

-   If you don't have pipenv, install it with `brew install pipenv`.
-   Clone the directory, cd into it, and then run `pipenv shell` followed by `pipenv install`
-   Run the command `flask run` or `python3 app.py` and everything, in theory, should work!
