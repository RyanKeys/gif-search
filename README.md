# gif-search

Tenor gif search web application built using flask as a collaboration project with @RyanKeys

## To get up and running:

-   If you don't have pipenv, install it with `brew install pipenv`
-   Clone the directory, cd into it, and then run `pipenv shell` to active the virtual env.
-   Run `pipenv install` to install all the packages that the program requires to run.
-   Run the command `flask run` or `python3 app.py` to get the server up and running!
